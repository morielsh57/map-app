# Running the project
- clone the repository
- run the following commands in the project's root directory :
  - npm install
  - npm run server
  - npm start (in new terminal)

## Notes
I used a **json-server** as a mock.
<br />All the data is written to **/coordinates.json**
<br />To view the data in the browser go to: http://localhost:5000/coordinates
